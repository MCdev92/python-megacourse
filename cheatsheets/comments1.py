# How to use the python console to find methods

# Commands: 

# >>> dir(str) will show all string methods you can use in python
# >>> help(str.methodname) ex: >>> help(str.capitalize) will information about what this method does

# >>> dir(list) will show all list methods you can use in python
# >>> help(list.methodname) will give you information about the method

# >>> import builtins to import python functions
# >>> dir(builtins) will show you a list of functions that you can use in python

# .title() method will convert the first letter capital
# .capitalize() will convert only the first letter of a string capital

# Floats and Integers are used to do math operations in python
# You can convert strings into numbers by using float() or int(). i.e: int("10") = 10, float("5") = 5.0

# The sanme is true for strings. You can change numbers into string by using str()

# The function type() will return the type of format of an argument. i.e: x = 10.0 , type(x) = <float>

# we can use two ways to import functions:
# from functions import get_todos, write_todos, , , , ....... or
# import functions and add functions.nameofFunction i.e: funnction.get_todos()
